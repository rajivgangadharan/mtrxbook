###  Cycle Time


#### Summary

The below [Five-number summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-number_summary) will provide a high level distribution of the cycle times. 

```{r opics-cycle-time-summ, include=TRUE, out.width='80%', echo=FALSE}
tabulate.TypeAndPriorityBasedCycleTimeStat(tib)
```

#### Epics


```{r opics-epics-cycle-time-trend-fig, include=TRUE, out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Cycle Time Trend", echo=FALSE}
loess_plot.CycleTimeTrend(epics.closed, col_date="crdt")
```


```{r opics-epics-summary-metrics, include=TRUE, out.width='80%', echo=FALSE}
 tabulate.PriorityBasedCycleTimeStat(epics.closed)
```

#### Stories

```{r opics-stories-cycle-time-trend-fig, include=TRUE, out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Cycle Time Trend", echo=FALSE}

loess_plot.CycleTimeTrend(stories.closed, col_date="crdt")

```


```{r opics-story-summary-metrics, include=TRUE, out.width='80%', echo=FALSE}

```

### Throughput

#### Epics

```{r opics-completed-epics-week-fig, out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center', fig.cap = "Closed Epics by Week", echo=FALSE}

line_plot.NumClosed_For_FloorDate(
  gen_ds.NumClosed_For_FloorDate(epics.closed)

```

- Density distribution

Gives and indication of the densities especially the occurrence of multiple maxima in the data. This can be due to multiple categories of work items which may be investigated further.

###  Cycle Time

Below is the [5 Number Summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-number_summary) of the entire data set. The 75% Qartile value is significant because that is the number which you can typically see as the turn around time (TAT) to service a defect.

#### Summary

```{r opics-defects-tab-cycle-time-basic-stats, out.width="80%", echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}

tabulate.CycleTimeStat(tib_defects.closed, tab_caption = "5 Number Summary")

```


#### Cycle Time Trend

This reflects the capacity/capability of the team to resolve across all 
priorities as indicated by a trend.

- Density distribution

Gives and indication of the densities especially the occurrence of multiple maxima in the data. This can be due to multiple categories of work items which may be investigated further. Below are the violin plots for all defects and also high and critical defects.
