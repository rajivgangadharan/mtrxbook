# Introduction {#intro}

The **Portfolio Insights** initiative strives to enable decision making  and risk management grounded in data. It will also help quantify and illustrate value gains to the executive tied to delivery improvement initiatives. 

## Cycle Time
Cycle time is the time taken for an individual work item to move from the beginning of the delivery pipeline ("Created Time") to the end of the pipe line ("Closed"). Customers like the cycle time to be as small as possible.

## Work in Progress (WiP) {#wip}
It is the inventory that is held by the system in various unfinished forms. Greater the WiP the greater will be the cycle time. A reduction in WiP will result in a decrease in cycle time.
