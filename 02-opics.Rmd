###  Cycle Time


#### Summary

The below [Five-number summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-number_summary) will provide a high level distribution of the cycle times. 

```{r opics-cycle-time-summ, include=TRUE, out.width='80%', echo=FALSE}
tabulate.TypeAndPriorityBasedCycleTimeStat(tib)
```

#### Epics


```{r opics-epics-cycle-time-trend-fig, include=TRUE, out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Cycle Time Trend", echo=FALSE}
loess_plot.CycleTimeTrend(epics.closed)
```


```{r opics-epics-summary-metrics, include=TRUE, out.width='80%', echo=FALSE}
 tabulate.PriorityBasedCycleTimeStat(epics.closed)
```

#### Stories

```{r opics-stories-cycle-time-trend-fig, include=TRUE, out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Cycle Time Trend", echo=FALSE}

loess_plot.CycleTimeTrend(stories.closed)

```


```{r opics-story-summary-metrics, include=TRUE, out.width='80%', echo=FALSE}

tabulate.PriorityBasedCycleTimeStat(stories.closed)

```

### Throughput

#### Epics

```{r opics-completed-epics-week-fig, out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center', fig.cap = "Closed Epics by Week", echo=FALSE}

line_plot.NumClosed_For_FloorDate(
  gen_ds.NumClosed_For_FloorDate(epics.closed)
)

```

The plot below shows the number of epics closed in every week, marked separately in different color based on priority

```{r opics-epics-wk-agg-fig, include=TRUE, out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}

bar_plot.NumClosed_For_FloorDate(
  gen_ds.NumClosed_For_FloorDate(epics.closed, priority_based=TRUE)
)

```

- Density distribution

Gives and indication of the densities especially the occurrence of multiple maxima in the data. This can be due to multiple categories of work items which may be investigated further. 

```{r opics-density-distibution-closed-epics-fig, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Priority based Density Distribution", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
epics.closed %>% violin_plot.CycleTimeVsPriority(pal_option = 'D')
```


#### Stories


Tells us the number of work items (stories) completed aggregated for each 
week which is an indication of how stable the throughput is.

```{r opics-completed-items-week-fig, out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}

line_plot.NumClosed_For_FloorDate(
  gen_ds.NumClosed_For_FloorDate(stories.closed)

```{r opics-stories-wk-agg-fig, include=TRUE, out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Number of Stories Closed in a Week colored by Priority", echo=FALSE}

bar_plot.NumClosed_For_FloorDate(
  gen_ds.NumClosed_For_FloorDate(stories.closed, priority_based=TRUE)

```

- Density distribution

Gives and indication of the densities especially the occurrence of multiple maxima in the data. This can be due to multiple categories of work items which may be investigated further.

### Work in Progress (WiP)

#### Epics 

Data is too less at this stage to pass it though the WiP Compute Algorithm. 

#### Stories


```{r opics-stories-work-in-progress, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
tib_stories_work_in_progress <- tib.all %>%

## Defect Metrics

```

###  Cycle Time

Below is the [5 Number Summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-number_summary) of the entire data set. The 75% Qartile value is significant because that is the number which you can typically see as the turn around time (TAT) to service a defect.

#### Summary

- Density distribution

Gives and indication of the densities especially the occurrence of multiple maxima in the data. This can be due to multiple categories of work items which may be investigated further. Below are the violin plots for all defects and also high and critical defects.
